Recently, I have been working on a feature that allows capturing full-page screenshots within our application. 
Considering its potential benefits across various applications, I propose investing time to make this a generic feature within our framework.
While I understand that investing time beyond regular working hours is a commitment, 
I believe the long-term benefits of having this generic feature will outweigh the initial effort. Additionally, it aligns with our goal of maintaining a robust and adaptable framework.

I am more than willing to lead this initiative and collaborate with the team to ensure a smooth integration process. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
