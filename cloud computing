Cloud computing encompasses various service models, commonly categorized into three main types:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
   - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
   - Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components.
   - Examples include Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
   - Offers a platform that allows users to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
   - Developers focus on coding, while the platform handles aspects like runtime, OS, and middleware.
   - Examples include Google App Engine and Heroku.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):**
   - Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
   - Users access the software through a web browser without needing to install or maintain it locally.
   - Examples include Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365.

These models represent a spectrum of abstraction and management responsibility, allowing users to choose the level of control and customization that best suits their requirements.




Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including computing power, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more, over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers or infrastructure, users can access and use these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. Cloud computing provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, allowing individuals and businesses to focus on their applications and data without the need to manage the underlying hardware. It offers various service models, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
