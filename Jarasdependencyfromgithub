To use your Maven project hosted on GitHub as a dependency in another project, you can follow these steps:

1. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Make sure your Maven project is hosted on GitHub.

2. **Create a Release:**
   - Go to the "Releases" section of your GitHub repository.
   - Create a new release.
   - Specify a version number (e.g., `1.0.0`) and any release notes.
   - Attach the JAR file generated by your Maven project to the release.

3. **Repository Configuration (pom.xml):**
   - In the `pom.xml` file of the project where you want to use your Maven project as a dependency, add a `<repositories>` section:

     ```xml
     <repositories>
         <repository>
             <id>github-repo</id>
             <url>https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository/raw/main/</url>
         </repository>
     </repositories>
     ```

     Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repository` with the name of your repository.

4. **Dependency Configuration (pom.xml):**
   - Add a `<dependencies>` section and include your Maven project as a dependency:

     ```xml
     <dependencies>
         <dependency>
             <groupId>com.github.yourusername</groupId>
             <artifactId>your-artifact-id</artifactId>
             <version>1.0.0</version>
         </dependency>
     </dependencies>
     ```

     Replace `yourusername`, `your-artifact-id`, and `1.0.0` with your GitHub username, the artifactId of your Maven project, and the version number you specified in the release.

5. **Build Your Project:**
   - Build the project where you added the dependency (`mvn clean install`). Maven will download your project's JAR from the specified GitHub repository and include it as a dependency.

Make sure your JAR file is correctly attached to the GitHub release, and the version numbers in the dependency configuration match the version you released. Additionally, ensure that your GitHub repository is public or that the project where you're using the dependency has the necessary access to the repository.
