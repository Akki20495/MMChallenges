The IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) is an 11-character alphanumeric code used to uniquely identify bank branches
 within the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) network in India. The structure of the IFSC code is as follows:

1. The first four characters represent the bank code.
2. The fifth character is always "0" (zero).
3. The last six characters uniquely identify the specific branch of the bank.

So, the total length of an IFSC code is 11 characters. For example, an IFSC code might look like this: "ABCD0123456". In this example, "ABCD" is the bank code, "0" is the fifth character, and "123456" uniquely identifies the branch.
